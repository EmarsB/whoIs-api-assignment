# TLV300- Home Assignment for Frontend Developer

This repository is dedicated as a submission to a frontend application. This exercises showcases a frontend interface which directly interacts with the Whois API.

Relatively, the technologies/packages used are the following:

- [React JS](https://react.dev/) - Library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Styling
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### Extra Notes

- `.env` will be committed for the mean time to make sure the application will run without extra configuration. It is with due diligence and acknowledgement the security of API key but in this case will be let through to ensure the assessment will be seemless.
